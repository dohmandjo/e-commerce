# Overview

iFoodCostEstimate is a software that helps companies estimate the cost of a meal from a customer order. There is a menu provided to the customer and once the customer chooses a meal, the software gives an estimate to the restaurant company how much it is going to them to make that meal based on the various ingredients prices from the market.

This software will help restaurants businesses to get a quick estimate of how much it cost them to make a meal. Then, it will be easier to see how much they see the revenue. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
