# Overview

FoodCostEstimate is a software that helps restaurant estimate the cost of a meal from a customer order. When the customer chooses a meal, the software gives an estimate to the restaurant on how much it is going to cost them to make that meal based on the various items' prices that make the meal.

This software will help restaurants businesses to get a quick estimate of how much it is going to cost them to make the meal. Then, it will be easier for them to see how much they make from this service. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Have a menu list to enable the customer to choose from
- Add a recipe for each meal/food in the menu with the right amount of ingredients
- Store all the data for the food items/ingredients prices in a database. That will enable the business to keep track on changes of food item costs in order to customize the meal prices and do not loose profits.
- Build a Web App for the software.
